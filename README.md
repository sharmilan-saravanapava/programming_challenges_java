# Welcome to the Programming Challenges Java!

The purpose of this repo is to simply improve programming, whether it would be a specific language, 
improving readability, or even getting the basics of git

Here I will tell you how you can collaborate and improve your coding techniques 😄 

# Getting Started

## Dependencies
First things first! You have to make sure that your system has **git**. If you already have git on your system
then please skip to **Cloning to your system**.

### Mac
Please paste this to your terminal `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Once completed, then run `brew install git`, and voila!

Run the following commands to configure your Git username and email using the following commands, this will be used to set your **name** and **email**. These details will be associated with any commits that you create:

`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

`git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"`

You have git on your system so you can start the coding 👩‍💻 👨‍💻

### Windows
1. Download the latest [Git for Windows Installer](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)

2. When you've successfully started the installer, you should see the **Git Setup** wizard screen. Follow the **Next** and **Finish** prompts to complete the installation. The default options are pretty sensible for most users.

3. Open a Command Prompt (or Git Bash if during installation you elected not to use Git from the Windows Command Prompt).

4. Run the following commands to configure your Git username and email using the following commands, this will be used to set your **name** and **email**. These details will be associated with any commits that you create:

`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

`git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"`

You have git on your system so you can start the coding 👩‍💻 👨‍💻

Another thing you are going to need if you are on **Windows** is to install **MinGW** which can be done [here](http://www.mingw.org/)

# Cloning to your system

## Step 1. 
Click the ***Clone or Download Button***

## Step 2. 
Make sure you are on the mode ***Clone with HTTPS***, then click the copy icon
![](https://github.com/niroigen/programming_challenges/blob/master/images/Step_2.png)

## Step 3.
Launch **terminal**.

## Step 4.
If you are on **Mac** or **Linux** enter `cd` in the terminal


If you are on **Windows** then enter `cd %HOMEPATH%`


Then type `git clone ` followed by the **url** which you just **copied**

## Step 5.
If all went well and you type `ls` (or `dir` on **Windows**) on your terminal, you should see `programming_challenges` there! 🎊
